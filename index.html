        <p>Death Stranding takes place in a future America reshaped by a mysterious catastrophe that blurred the line between life and death, leaving behind a lonely but breathtaking wilderness filled with dangers both natural and supernatural. Timefall—rain that rapidly ages anything it touches—falls across vast plains, mountains, rivers, and ruins, while invisible entities known as BTs haunt areas where the worlds of the living and dead overlap. Humanity survives in scattered underground cities and remote outposts connected only by Porters: delivery specialists who carry vital cargo across the wild terrain. This world runs on chiral technology, a strange new form of matter that enables advanced communication, 3D fabrication, and the continent-spanning Chiral Network, a system meant to reconnect isolated people. The setting blends science fiction, metaphysics, and stark natural beauty into a meditative atmosphere centered on themes of connection, isolation, perseverance, and the fragile bonds that hold society together.</p>
